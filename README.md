Chinotto: Custom assertions for [Chai.js](https://www.chaijs.com)
=================================================================

[![Build status: TravisCI][TravisCI-badge]][TravisCI-link]
[![Build status: AppVeyor][AppVeyor-badge]][AppVeyor-link]

Compilation of useful Chai assertions that I've written over time,
migrated from the test-suites of various projects ([`atom-mocha`][]
in particular).

Documentation and a spiffy picture of fruit to be added at a later
date, once I'm finished wrestling with Rollup.
